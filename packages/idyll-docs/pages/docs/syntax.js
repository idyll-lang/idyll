#### A short note


We provide syntax highlighting plugins for several editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathisonian.idyll-syntax)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-idyll)

If you'd like a syntax highlighter for a different editor, please [open an issue on github](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/issues).

*Idyll tries to maintain parity with popular markdown implementations,
but sometimes doesn't get things exactly right. If something seems off,
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ACompiler).*


<h2 id="text">Text</h2>

By default everything in Idyll is text. To make common
formatting tasks easier, Idyll borrows some syntax from markdown.

<h4 id="bold-italic">Bold, italic</h4>

Text surrounded by asterisks (\`*\`) will be bolded,
e.g. \`*italic*\` becomes *italic*, and \`**bold**\` becomes **bold**.

<h4 id="headers">Headers</h4>

Use a pound sign (\`#\`) to denote a header:

\`\`\`
# Title h1
## Title h2
### Title h3
#### Title h4
##### Title h5
###### Title h6
\`\`\`

<h4 id="code">Code</h4>

Text placed between backticks (\\\`) will be displayed inline
as code: \`\` \`y = x * x\` \`\` becomes \`y = x * x\`.

Text placed between groups of three backticks will be displayed as
a code block.

\`\`\`
This is a code block
\`\`\`

The above code block is created with this code:
\`\`\`
\\\`\\\`\\\`
This is a code block
\\\`\\\`\\\`
\`\`\`


<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

Besides text, components are the other basic building block of an Idyll document.
Components are denoted with brackets, and can be invoked in one of two ways: they can be self
closing,

\`\`\`
[Range min:0 max:10 value:value /]
\`\`\`

or have a closing and opening tag with content in between.

<h3 id="component-properties">Component properties</h3>

Properties can be passed into components
in the following ways:

<h4 id="literals">Literals: number, string, boolean</h4>

Number, string, or boolean literals may be used.

\`\`\`
[Component propName:10 /]
[Component propName:'propValue' /]
[Component propName:false /]
\`\`\`

<h4 id="variables-and-datasets">Variable and datasets</h4>

A variable or dataset can be passed in directly, this will
automatically create a binding between that variable and property,
more on this in the section on [variables and datasets](/components-variables-and-datasets).

\`\`\`
[Component propName:myVar /]
\`\`\`

If the variable changes that update will immediately be reflected in the
state of the component.

<h4 id="expressions">Expressions</h4>

Use backticks to pass an evaluated expression:

\`\`\`
[Component propName:\\\`2 * 2 * 2\\\` /]
[Component propName:\\\`{ an: 'object' }\\\` /]
\`\`\`

Note that because Idyll is reactive, if a variable changes, any expressions that reference that
variable will immediately be recomputed. See this utilized to create reactive vega-lite specifications:
https://idyll-lang.github.io/examples/csv/.

If the property expects a function,
the expression will automatically be
converted to a callback. This is convenient
for updating variables on events, for example.

\`\`\`
[Component onClick:\\\`myVar++\\\` /]
\`\`\`

Idyll uses naming conventions to determine if the expression should be converted to a callback.
Properties that are named \`onXxxxx\` (e.g. \`onClick\`) or \`handleYyyyy\` (e.g. \`handleMouseMove\`) are
assumed to expect callbacks.


<h4 id="refs">Refs</h4>

There is a special property called \`ref\` that allows you to create a reference to specific
component on the page. This is primarily used to keep track of elements on the page as
a reader scrolls. See the section on [refs](/components-refs) for more details.


<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

Variables can be declared at any point in an Idyll file. Variables use
the same syntax as a component, but must defined a \`name\` and a \`value\`
property.

\`\`\`
[var name:'x' value:10 /]
\`\`\`

The above code defines a variable \`x\`, with the initial value of \`10\`.

<h3 id="derived-variables">Derived Variables</h3>

A derived variable is similar to a \`var\`, but its value is derived from
other variables, and is recomputed whenever values change:

\`\`\`
[derived name:'xSquared' value:\\\`x * x\\\` /]
\`\`\`

The above code defines a derived variable \`xSquared\` that depends
on the value of \`x\`. The value of \`xSquared\` is automatically updated
based on the value of \`x\`.

<h2 id="datasets">Datasets</h2>

A dataset is similar to a variable, except instead of expecting a
\`value\`, datasets must be provided with a \`source\` (the name of the data file).

Example:

\`\`\`
[data name:'myData' source:'myData.csv' /]
[Table data:myData /]
\`\`\`

The above code declares a dataset, and uses it as input to a \`Table\` component.
Datasets can be either \`.csv\` or \`.json\` files. CSV files will automatically be
converted to a JSON object.
