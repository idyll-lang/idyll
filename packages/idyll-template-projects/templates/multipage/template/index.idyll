## Introduction

This is an Idyll post. It is generated via
the file `index.idyll`. To compile this post using
idyll, run the command `idyll` inside of this directory.


Idyll posts are designed to support interaction and
data-driven graphics.

[var name:"state" value:0 /]
[CustomD3Component className:"d3-component" state:state /]
[button onClick:`state++`]
  Click Me.
[/button]

Configuration can be done via the `idyll` field in `package.json`.

## Markup

Idyll is based on Markdown.

You can use familiar syntax
to create **bold** (`**bold**` ) and *italic* (``*italic*` ) styles,

* lists
* of
* items,

```

## Components

Components can be embedded using a bracket syntax:

```
[Range /]
```

and can contain nested content:

```
[Equation]e = mc^{2}[/Equation]
```

Components accept properties:

```
[Range value:x min:0 max:1 /]
```

that can be bound to variables to achieve interactivity (more in next section).


A variety of components are included by default. See [all the available components](https://idyll-lang.org/docs/components/). You can also use any html tag, for example: `[div] A div! [/div]`.

To create your own, add it to the `components/` folder. There are examples of how to use Idyll with React and D3 based components already included.



## Interactivity

Here is how you can instantiate a variable and bind it to a component:

[var name:"exampleVar" value:5 /]

[Range min:0 max:10 value:exampleVar /]
[Display value:exampleVar /]

```
[var name:"exampleVar" value:5 /]

[Range min:0 max:10 value:exampleVar /]
[Display value:exampleVar /]
```
