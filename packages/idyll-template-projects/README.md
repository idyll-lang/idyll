Scaffolding for new Idyll projects

## Usage

This package is meant to be used with the Idyll CLI tool:

First, install the idyll CLI tool globally:
```bash
npm install -g idyll
```

Then, run Idyll's `create-project` subcommand, which will present you with an interactive
selector for project templates:
```bash
idyll create-project
```

## Available Templates

1. [`basic`](templates/basic): a barebones Idyll project.
