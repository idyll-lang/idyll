This is an Idyll file. Write text
as you please in here. To add interactivity,
you can add  different components to the text.

Here is how you can use a variable:

[var name:"exampleVar" value:5 /]

[Range min:0 max:10 value:exampleVar /]
[DisplayVar var:exampleVar /]

```
var code = true;
```

And here is a custom component:

[CustomComponent /]

You can use standard html tags if a
component with the same name
doesn't exist.
