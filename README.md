# What is Idyll?

Idyll is a tool that makes it easier to author interactive narratives for the web. The goal of the project is to provide a friendly markup language — and an associated toolchain — that can be used to create dynamic, text-driven web pages.

Idyll helps you create documents that use common narrative techniques such as embedding interactive charts and graphs, responding to scroll events, and explorable explanations. Additionally, its readable syntax facilitates collaboration between writers, editors, designers, and programmers on complex projects.

In Idyll the entire document is reactive, built on top of Facebook's React framework. Changes immediately propagate through the entire page, taking the pain out of creating data-driven experiences that respond to reader input. You don't need to know anything about React to use Idyll, but if you do, it is easy to extend with your own custom components.
